# Facial-Expressions-Model
Facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted, and neutral show human emotions through eye, mouth, and brow movements. Happy has smiles and bright eyes; sad shows drooping features; angry has tense muscles and frowns. Surprise opens the eyes and mouth wide, fear tenses the face, disgust wrinkles the nose.
